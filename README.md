Independent Project #1

Hello 👋🏾 👋🏾👋🏾
Am Roy Kimari.
I have a passion for computer hardware💪🏿. I enjoy it so much. But that being the case, I have to improve my software skills in order to be the best at my profession. This project requires me to create a fan site for my favorite band. 
As of the moment, I don't listen to music so much because it affects somebody's mood. We may not realise it but music feeds our emotions which keeps us in a constant state of feeling. I have been listening to mostly rock, R&B, and hip hop but as of the moment I want to start listening to more gospel music. The reason behind this is that it always finds a way to motivate me. I'm not yet at a level where I can recommend you an appropriate playlist for anybody.
I have majorly used HTML in my code. I will continually commit JavaScript and CSS to my code with time as I improve my skills, which are not at the level I would like it to be in a few weeks to come or months.
May this be the start of a great career and profession ahead of me.💯
